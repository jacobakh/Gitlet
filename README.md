# Gitlet
Abstract: Develop program to create repositories, merge branches, commit/stage files, etc.; a version control program that replicates Git

 This version-control system mimics some of the basic features of the popular version-control system git, but it is smaller and simpler, so we have named it gitlet.

A version-control system is essentially a backup system for files on your computer. The main functionality that gitlet supports is:

Saving backups of directories of files. In gitlet, this is called committing, and the backups themselves are called commits.
Restoring a backup version of one or more files or entire commits. In gitlet, this is called checking out those files or that commit.
Viewing the history of your backups. In gitlet, you view this history in something called the log.
Maintaining related sequences of commits, called branches.
Merging changes made in one branch into another.
